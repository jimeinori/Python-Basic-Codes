'''

Each character in a string is assigned a number.
This number is called the index.

'''

m = "mother"[0]
t = "father"[3]

'''

> In the above example,
  we create a new variable called m
  and set it to "m", the character
  at index zero of the string "mother".

> Next, we create a new variable
  called t and set it to "t",
  the character at index three of the string "father".

> Notice that in the first "cat" example we are
  calling the 0th letter of "cat" and getting "c"
  in return. This is because in Python indices begin
  counting at 0. Therefore, in the string "cats",
  the first letter, "c", is at the 0th index and
  the last letter, "s", is at the 3rd index.
--------------------------------------------------------
The string "PYTHON" has six characters,
numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| P | Y | T | H | O | N |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
0   1   2   3   4   5

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type
"PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)
