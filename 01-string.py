print("While double-quotes and single-quotes")
print('are both acceptable ways to define a string,')
print('a string needs to be opened and closed by the same type of quote mark.')
print("We can combine multiple strings using '+'.")
#First combination of text: You are
#Second text: cool
#Simply add them to create a string!
print("Outcome will be:")
print("You are " + "cool.")
#There are some characters that cause problems.
#For example:'There's a snake in my boot!'
#We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:
#'There\'s a snake in my boot!'
