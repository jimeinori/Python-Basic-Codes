#String methods let you perform specific tasks for strings.

'''

    len() - gets the length (the number of characters) of a string.
    lower() - you can use this to get rid of all the capitalization.
    upper() - makes your string all in capital letters.
    str() -  turns non-strings into strings.
'''

#len() example:

dog = "Chow Chow"
print(len(dog))

#lower() example:

fish = "Bank Sea Bass"
print(fish.lower())

#upper() example:

meal = "adobong manok"
print(meal.upper())

#str() example:

yourmoney = 100.25
print(str(yourmoney))

'''
DOT NOTATION:
Methods that use dot notation only work with strings.

On the other hand, len() and str() can work on other data types.
